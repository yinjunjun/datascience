University Policies Academic Integrity Code Academic integrity is an essential part of the educational process, and all members of the GW community take these matters very seriously. As the instructor of record for this course, my role is to provide clear expectations and uphold them in all assessments. Violations of academic integrity occur when students fail to cite research sources properly, engage in unauthorized collaboration, falsify data, and otherwise violate the Code of Academic Integrity. If you have any questions about whether particular academic practices or resources are permitted, you should ask me for clarification. If you are reported for an academic integrity violation, you should contact Conflict Education and Student Accountability (CESA) to learn more about your rights and options. Consequences can range from failure of assignment to expulsion from the University and may include a transcript notation. More info: students.gwu.edu/code-academic-integrity or cesa@gwu.edu. University policy on observance of religious holidays Students must notify faculty during the first week of the semester, or as early as possible, but no later than three weeks prior to the absence, of their intention to be absent for religious observance. See details at provost.gwu.edu/policies-procedures-and-guidelines . Use of Electronic Course Materials and Class Recordings Students are encouraged to use electronic course materials for private personal use in connection with their academic program of study. These materials should not be shared or used for non-course related purposes unless express permission is granted by the instructor. Academic Support Academic Commons Academic Commons is the central location for academic support resources for GW students.
