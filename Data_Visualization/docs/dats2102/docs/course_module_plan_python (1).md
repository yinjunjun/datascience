## Course Description

This is a new Python-based version of DATS 2102 that teaches the full visualization workflow: collecting/cleaning data, exploring/analyzing data, and communicating insights with effective, ethical visuals. We will work primarily in Jupyter with the Python ecosystem (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, `altair`, `geopandas`) and practice reproducible, well-documented analysis.

> **Note on alignment with prior offerings**: The course structure mirrors the successful pedagogy used in past R-based offerings to support continuity of learning. Students interested in R or comparative study can consult the R course site later in the syllabus. The present course is implemented entirely in **Python**.

## Learning Objectives

- Process and tidy real-world data using `pandas`.
- Apply visual perception and design principles to create truthful, clear graphics.
- Visualize univariate, bivariate, and multivariate patterns; compare groups effectively.
- Map and analyze geographic data using `geopandas`, `contextily`, and `folium`/`plotly`.
- Visualize relationships and communicate model context and uncertainty.
- Build interactive, annotated visuals and simple data stories/dashboards.
- Apply visualization to ML & NLP tasks (feature importance, confusion matrices/ROC, word clouds, BERTopic topic maps, embedding plots).

- **Week 7**: Text, Labels, & Tables — direct labeling, captions, tables.
- **Week 8**: Mapping I — choropleths, CRS, spatial joins, geopandas, mapclassify, folium.
- **Week 9**: Color & Accessibility — sequential/diverging/qualitative palettes, pitfalls.
- **Week 10**: Relationships & Modeling — scatter/line, smoothing, statsmodels, model checks.
- **Week 11**: Uncertainty — error bars, intervals, bootstrap visuals.
- **Week 12**: Visualization for ML/NLP — feature importance, confusion/ROC-PR, word clouds, BERTopic, UMAP embeddings.
- **Week 13–14**: Final Project Workshops — scoping, refinement, narrative.
