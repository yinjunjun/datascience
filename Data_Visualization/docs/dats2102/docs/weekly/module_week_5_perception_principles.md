# Week 5 ‚Äî Perception & Principles

> Applying visual perception theory and design principles to create effective, truthful, and clear visualizations.

---

## üìñ Background & Motivation

Even when the data is clean and the chart type is appropriate, design decisions can make the difference between clarity and confusion. Human perception imposes limits on how well we can decode visual information. By understanding principles from perceptual psychology, we can design graphics that communicate more effectively and avoid misleading audiences.

This week introduces concepts like Cleveland & McGill‚Äôs hierarchy of graphical perception, preattentive attributes, Gestalt principles, and common pitfalls in chart design. These theoretical foundations provide guidance for making practical design decisions in your visualizations.

## üîé Learning Objectives

- Understand how human perception shapes data interpretation.
- Apply the Cleveland‚ÄìMcGill perceptual rankings to select more effective encodings.
- Identify and use preattentive features to guide viewer attention.
- Recognize and correct misleading design practices.

## üíª Starter Notebook Snippets

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Example of a misleading bar chart
values = [5, 10, 15]
labels = ['A', 'B', 'C']

plt.bar(labels, values)
plt.ylim(4, 16)  # Misleading y-axis range
plt.title("Misleading Bar Chart")
plt.show()

# Redesigned chart with zero baseline
plt.bar(labels, values)
plt.ylim(0, 16)
plt.title("Improved Bar Chart")
plt.show()
```

## üß™ In-Class Activity

- Critique provided "poorly-designed" charts and redesign them.
- Use preattentive attributes to highlight important data points.
- Compare multiple encoding strategies for the same dataset.

---

## üè† Homework (Due next Thursday, Oct 2)

1. Find a poorly designed chart (for example, a truncated y-axis bar chart from a news article, a rainbow-colored heatmap in a research paper, or an infographic with distorted area encodings).¬†
2. Recreate the chart faithfully in Python.
3. Redesign the chart applying perception & design principles.
4. Write a short reflection (200+ words) describing:
   - Why the original was misleading or ineffective.
   - What principles guided your redesign?
   - How your redesign improves comprehension.
5. Submit `.ipynb` and `.html`.

**Rubric (10 pts)**

- Accurate reproduction of the original chart (2)
- Effective redesign applying principles (4)
- Clear reflection linking to theory (2)
- Visual clarity and labeling (2)

---

## üß© Optional Extensions

- Experiment with alternative encodings and compare effectiveness.
- Conduct a quick peer survey: which design is easier to interpret?
- Try adding annotations or highlights using preattentive cues.
