# Mid-Term Project — DATS 2102: Data Visualization for Data Science

> A project assignment for the first half of the course (Weeks 1–6).

---

## 🎯 Objectives

By mid-semester, you will:

- Apply foundational data visualization techniques (Weeks 1–6).
- Demonstrate mastery of:  
    -  environment setup & reproducible notebooks,
    - tidy data principles & visual encodings,
    - distributions & variation,
    - wrangling with pandas,
    - perception-based design principles,
    - fair and effective comparisons.
- Produce a **mini data story** using 2–3 datasets.

---

## 📖 Project Description

Select a **real-world dataset** (from provided sources or external datasets of interest). Using the tools and concepts learned in the first six weeks, create a **narrative notebook** that:

1. Introduces the dataset and research question(s).
2. Cleans, reshapes, and prepares the data for visualization, demonstrating core pandas wrangling: selection/filtering, sorting, grouping + aggregation, joins/merges, and tidy reshaping.
3. Produces **at least 6–8 visualizations**, including:
    - At least **one distribution plot** (histogram/KDE/boxplot/ECDF).
    - At least **one comparison plot** (dot plot, slope chart, or small multiples).
    - At least **one of your own visualizations revised and improved by reflecting on perception principles**, showing how thoughtful design choices enhance clarity and fairness.
    - At least **one visualization with clear text/labels/annotations**.
4. Applies best practices for **choice of color, scales, and labeling**.
5. Provides a written narrative explaining insights, choices, and design considerations.

## 📦 Deliverables

- **Jupyter Notebook** with all code, markdown explanations, and charts.
- **Rendered HTML file** (via Quarto).
- A **short reflective essay** (300–500 words) addressing:
    - What challenges did you face in cleaning/visualizing the data?
    - How did perception/design principles guide your choices?
    - Which visualization best communicates your main insight, and why?
