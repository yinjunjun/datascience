# Week 1 — Getting Started

> Welcome to DATS 2102. Let's get started with the setup of the environment and the first steps in data visualization.

---

## 📖 Background & Motivation

Data visualization is the bridge between raw data and human understanding. In data science, visualizations are not just decorative — they are powerful analytical tools that help reveal patterns, outliers, and trends that might remain hidden in tables or statistical summaries.

Well-designed visualizations can:

- Tell compelling, evidence-based stories that influence decision-making.
- Make complex concepts easier to grasp for diverse audiences.
- Identify and expose errors or inconsistencies in data during the exploratory stage.
- Enable collaboration between technical and non-technical stakeholders.

**Applications span across domains:**

- **Public health:** Tracking disease spread with interactive dashboards.
- **Climate science:** Mapping temperature anomalies over decades.
- **Business analytics:** Visualizing customer behavior or sales performance.
- **Machine learning:** Understanding model performance through ROC curves, feature importance charts, or clustering visualizations.

As data science projects grow in size and complexity, the ability to craft clear, truthful, and impactful visuals becomes as important as building the models themselves.

## 🔎 Learning Objectives

- Set up a reliable Python environment for data visualization.
- Navigate Jupyter Notebook/Lab and basic notebook hygiene (headings, code vs. markdown, restart & run all).
- Load and inspect tabular data with `pandas`.
- Produce the first charts with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

## 🛠️ Setup Checklist

1. **Install** Anaconda or Miniconda.
2. **Create/activate** environment using terminal:  
   `conda create -n dataviz python=3.12 -y`  
   `conda activate dataviz`    
3. **Install libraries** (CPU-friendly baseline):  
   `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly altair geopandas ipykernel jupyterlab`  
4. **Launch JupyterLab**:  
   `jupyter lab`  
5. (Optional) IDEs you can use: VS Code (or Google Antigravity, Positron), PyCharm, Sublime Text; or run in Google Colab.

**Troubleshooting**

- If `geopandas` fails on Windows, try:  
`conda install -c conda-forge geopandas`.
- If Jupyter can’t see the env, run:  
`python -m ipykernel install --user --name dataviz --display-name "Python (dataviz)"`.

## 🧭 Lecture Outline

### Session 1

1. Course overview & syllabus tour
2. Why visualization in data science? (truthfulness, clarity, audience)
3. Environment setup: conda + Jupyter walkthrough, troubleshooting
4. First dataset in `pandas`: load CSV → DataFrame → quick EDA

### Session 2

1. Recap + Q&A on environment setup
2. Notebook workflow: cells, markdown, restart & run all, saving
3. Basic plotting: `matplotlib` bar/line; `seaborn` scatter/histogram
4. Guided practice with `penguins` dataset: scatterplot, pairplot activity
5. Sample data 1 ([customers_1000.csv](week1/customers_1000.csv)); Sample data 2 ([life_journey_data.csv](week1/life_journey_data.csv)), Sample data 3 ([unemployment-x](week1/unemployment-x.csv))  
6. Check out the detailed instructions in a [Notebook](week1/week1_session2.html) and download the [week1_session2.ipynb](week1/week1_session2.ipynb)

## 💻 Starter Notebook Snippets

### Load a tiny dataset ([download the tab-separated file (tsv) version](cities.tsv))

```python
import pandas as pd

cities = pd.DataFrame({
    "city": ["DC", "NY", "LA", "Chicago", "Houston"],
    "population": [712_816, 8_336_817, 3_898_747, 2_746_388, 2_304_580]
})

cities.head()
```

### First charts (matplotlib → seaborn)

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Matplotlib bar chart
plt.bar(cities["city"], cities["population"])
plt.title("Population by City")
plt.xlabel("City"); plt.ylabel("Population")
plt.show()

# Seaborn bar chart
sns.barplot(data=cities, x="city", y="population")
plt.title("Population by City (Seaborn)")
plt.show()
```

### Quick EDA helpers

```python
cities.describe(include="all")
print("Missing values by column:\n", cities.isna().sum())
```

## 🧪 In-Class Activity

Using `seaborn.load_dataset("penguins")`:

- Make a scatterplot of **flipper\_length\_mm vs body\_mass\_g** colored by **species**.
- Add axis labels, a title, and a legend with a better title.
- Try a `seaborn.pairplot` to see relationships across multiple variables.

**Hints**

```python
penguins = sns.load_dataset("penguins").dropna()
ax = sns.scatterplot(data=penguins, x="flipper_length_mm", y="body_mass_g", hue="species")
ax.set(title="Penguins: Flipper vs Body Mass", xlabel="Flipper length (mm)", ylabel="Body mass (g)")
```

## 🏠 Homework

1. Set up your environment and confirm you can open/run notebooks.
2. Import a **CSV of your choice** and submit one notebook that includes:
   - A short markdown description of the dataset (source, what, who, when).
   - Top 5 rows, `.info()`, and `.describe()`.
   - One **bar** or **histogram** plot, and one **scatter** plot.
   - A brief paragraph reflecting on one insight + one limitation of the data.
3. Render notebook to HTML (`quarto preview <filename>.ipynb`) and upload zip file of `.ipynb`, `.html` and `_files` folder to Blackboard.

**Rubric (10 pts)**

- Reproducible environment & clean notebook structure (2)
- Correct loading/inspection & basic EDA (3)
- Two charts with sensible labels/titles (3)
- Insight + limitation reflection (2)

---

## 🧩 Optional Extensions

- Try the same chart in both `matplotlib` and `seaborn`; note the pros/cons you observe.
- Install `altair` (a declarative statistical visualization library for Python, built on top of Vega-Lite, useful for creating interactive charts with minimal code) and create the same scatterplot with tooltips.
- If you’re comfortable with maps, test your `geopandas` install (`geopandas.datasets.get_path('naturalearth_lowres')`).

---

## ✅ Submission Checklist

Before submitting, make sure:

- Your assignment has fulfilled all the basic requirements listed above.

- Use Quarto to render the notebook into HTML and zip the files for submission.

- Double-check the visualizations and your reflections in the HTML are properly organized and displayed.
