# Week 10 ‚Äî Relationships & Modeling

> Visualizing relationships, correlations, and model fits to understand data patterns and predictive insights.

---

## üìñ Background & Motivation

Beyond distributions and comparisons, data visualization can help us understand **relationships** between variables and evaluate **model performance**. This week introduces how to visualize bivariate relationships, regression fits, residuals, and uncertainty, providing the foundation for interpreting linear and non‚Äëlinear trends.

Students will learn how to use scatterplots, trend lines, confidence intervals, and diagnostic plots to explore patterns and assess model fit, combining statistical modeling with visual storytelling.

---

## üîé Learning Objectives

- Create scatterplots to explore relationships between two or more variables.
- Visualize regression lines and confidence intervals.
- Understand correlation vs. causation and potential pitfalls.
- Evaluate model residuals visually to check fit and assumptions.
- Communicate model performance and uncertainty through effective visualization.

## üìö Readings & Resources

- *Fundamentals of Data Visualization* ‚Äî chapters on relationships & uncertainty.
- Seaborn: [regplot and lmplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/regression.html)
- Statsmodels: [OLS Regression](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/examples/notebooks/generated/ols.html)

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Checklist

Ensure your environment includes:

```bash
pip install seaborn matplotlib statsmodels pandas numpy
```

Confirm you can run regression visualizations and calculate correlations using Seaborn and Statsmodels.

## üíª Starter Notebook Snippets

### Scatterplot with regression fit

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

penguins = sns.load_dataset("penguins").dropna()
sns.lmplot(data=penguins, x="flipper_length_mm", y="body_mass_g", hue="species", height=5, aspect=1.2)
plt.title("Flipper length vs Body mass with regression line")
plt.show()
```

### Correlation matrix heatmap

```python
import pandas as pd
corr = penguins.select_dtypes('number').corr()
sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', center=0)
plt.title("Correlation matrix of numeric features")
plt.show()
```

### Residual plot

```python
sns.residplot(data=penguins, x="flipper_length_mm", y="body_mass_g", lowess=True, color="#4e79a7")
plt.title("Residual plot: checking nonlinearity")
plt.show()
```

### Regression with Statsmodels

```python
import statsmodels.api as sm
X = penguins[["flipper_length_mm"]]
y = penguins["body_mass_g"]
X = sm.add_constant(X)
model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()
print(model.summary())

# Add predictions and visualize
penguins['pred'] = model.predict(X)
plt.scatter(penguins['flipper_length_mm'], y, label='Observed')
plt.plot(penguins['flipper_length_mm'], penguins['pred'], color='red', label='Fitted line')
plt.legend()
plt.title("OLS Regression Fit")
plt.show()
```

## üß™ In-Class Activity

- Create scatterplots for multiple variable pairs and interpret patterns.
- Build a simple regression model and visualize fit and residuals.
- Discuss what model visualization reveals beyond summary statistics.
- Explore an example of spurious correlation and discuss implications.

---

## üè† Homework (Due next Thursday, Nov 6)

1. Select a dataset of your choice (or continue from a previous week).
2. Produce the following:
   - One **scatterplot** with regression fit and confidence interval.
   - One **correlation matrix heatmap**.
   - One **residual plot** illustrating model fit or deviation.
3. Include a brief interpretation (200‚Äì300 words) explaining:
   - What relationships you observed.
   - How visualization helped confirm or question your assumptions.
4. Submit `.ipynb` and `.html`.

**Rubric (10 pts)**

- Correct implementation of regression and correlation plots (4)
- Quality of interpretation and insights (3)
- Clarity of visualizations and labeling (2)
- Code reproducibility and documentation (1)
