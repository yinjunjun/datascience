## Course Description
This course introduces students to the core principles and practices of data visualization within the context of data science. Students will learn how to collect, process, analyze, and communicate data-driven insights using effective and ethical visualization techniques. Emphasis will be placed on hands-on programming with Python’s visualization ecosystem (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, `altair`, `geopandas`) and applying best practices for clarity, accuracy, and storytelling. The course will cover visualization theory, design principles, and practical skills, including geographic data mapping and visualizing results from machine learning models. By the end of the semester, students will be able to produce high-quality visualizations that effectively communicate data insights to diverse audiences.

## Course Prerequisites
DATS 1001 and STAT 1051/1053/1111/1127, or permission of the instructor.

---

## Learning Outcomes
As a result of completing this course, students will be able to:
1. Process and tidy real-world data using `pandas`.
2. Apply visual perception and design principles to create truthful, clear graphics.
3. Visualize univariate, bivariate, and multivariate patterns; compare groups effectively.
4. Map and analyze geographic data using `geopandas`, `contextily`, and `folium`/`plotly`.
5. Visualize relationships and communicate model context and uncertainty.
6. Build interactive, annotated visuals and simple data stories/dashboards.
7. Apply visualization to ML & NLP tasks (feature importance, confusion matrices/ROC, word clouds, BERTopic topic maps, embedding plots).

## Course Workload
This is a 3-credit course. Students are expected to engage in 2.5 hours of direct instruction and a minimum of 5 hours of independent learning each week, for a combined minimum total of 7.5 hours per week or 112.5 hours over the semester.

## University Policies
**Academic Integrity Code**  
Academic integrity is an essential part of the educational process, and all members of the GW community take these matters very seriously. As the instructor of record for this course, my role is to provide clear expectations and uphold them in all assessments. Violations of academic integrity occur when students fail to cite research sources properly, engage in unauthorized collaboration, falsify data, and otherwise violate the Code of Academic Integrity. If you have any questions about whether particular academic practices or resources are permitted, you should ask me for clarification. If you are reported for an academic integrity violation, you should contact Conflict Education and Student Accountability (CESA) to learn more about your rights and options. Consequences can range from failure of assignment to expulsion from the University and may include a transcript notation. More info: [students.gwu.edu/code-academic-integrity](https://students.gwu.edu/code-academic-integrity) or cesa@gwu.edu.

**University policy on observance of religious holidays**  
Students must notify faculty during the first week of the semester, or as early as possible, but no later than three weeks prior to the absence, of their intention to be absent for religious observance. See details at [provost.gwu.edu/policies-procedures-and-guidelines](https://provost.gwu.edu/policies-procedures-and-guidelines).

**Use of Electronic Course Materials and Class Recordings**  
Students are encouraged to use electronic course materials for private personal use in connection with their academic program of study. These materials should not be shared or used for non-course related purposes unless express permission is granted by the instructor.
